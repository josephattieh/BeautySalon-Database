# BeautySalon-Database

_Submitted on Dec 2017 for the course COE 418 - Database Systems_

# Requirements:

In this project, we are required to create a database system using Java and SQL. The system should allows non-expert users to perform database commands without having to formulate formal SQL queries. The process required to build a Conceptual Data Model (CDM) then a Logical Data Model (LDM). The user input should be validated at all time and no illegal operations should be performed with the database. 

We chose to create a database application for a local Beauty Salon located in Beirut.
